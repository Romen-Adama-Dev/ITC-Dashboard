## üìã Project Overview

The **ITC Dashboard Project** (Final Degree Project at the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Canarias under NextGenDem research) provides:

- A **modular Angular library** of chart components (`ngx-charts`-based) for bar, line, pie, area, gauge, box and more.
- A **drag-and-drop dashboard** powered by angular-gridster2, allowing users to resize, rearrange and configure widgets at runtime.
- **Reactive data flows** built on RxJS, so any JSON or WebSocket source propagates instantly to all subscribed charts.
- **No-code customization** via Angular Forms and NG-Zorro modals: choose chart type, data source, item count, theme (light/dark) and localization (i18n via `ngx-translate`).
- A **Clean Architecture** separation (Domain ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Infrastructure ‚Üí Presentation) that ensures maintainability and extensibility.
- **Accessibility best practices** (WCAG AA contrast, keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes) and **internationalization** in multiple languages (ES, EN, +3).
- **Enterprise-grade code quality** with SonarCloud, ESLint, Conventional Commits and automatically generated documentation via Compodoc.

This repository contains both the reusable component library (`projects/`) and a stand-alone demo application (`src/`) that illustrates how to embed the library into any Angular workspace.

## üîß Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (LTS recommended; tested on v18.x and v20.x)  
- **npm** (v8.x or higher) or **yarn** (v1.22+)  
- **Angular CLI** (v19.x) installed globally  
- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) for development and demonstration

## ‚ö° Getting Started

### Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Romen-Adama-Dev/ITC-Dashboard.git
cd ITC-Dashboard
npm install
npm run lint     # checks for linting errors
npm run start    # starts the demo app at http://localhost:4200
npm run doc:serve  # serves Compodoc documentation at http://localhost:8080
```

### Available Scripts

- `npm run start` ‚Äî serve the demo app (http://localhost:4200)
- `npm run doc:serve` ‚Äî serve Compodoc documentation

## ‚≠ê Key Features

1. **Drag-and-Drop Dashboard**  
   - Based on `angular-gridster2`.  
   - Widgets can be moved, resized, locked/unlocked, serialized to JSON and reloaded.

2. **Modular Chart Components**  
   - Built on `ngx-charts` and `d3-shape`.  
   - Each chart (bar, line, pie, area, gauge, box, heatmap, etc.) lives in its own Angular component.  
   - Chart configuration (theme, axes, colors, labels) flows reactively via `ChartHelperService`.

3. **Reactive Data Flows (RxJS)**  
   - `MediatorService` acts as a centralized event bus.  
   - Chart components subscribe to `MediatorService.events$` and call `processEvent(...)` to update themselves instantly.  
   - `ChartDataService` fetches JSON or real-time WebSocket data and exposes an `Observable<ChartData[]>`.

4. **No-Code Customization UI**  
   - Add a widget via `ChartSelectionModalComponent`: pick chart type, data source (local JSON, REST, WebSocket).  
   - Edit a widget via `EditWidgetModalComponent`: adjust `dataCount`, axis labels, palette, title, legend and tooltip visibility.  
   - Language dropdown uses `ngx-translate` for dynamic UI translation.

5. **Theming & Accessibility**  
   - Light & Dark themes defined in `styles/default.less` and `styles/dark.less`.  
   - Theme toggle button dynamically enables/disables `<link id="dark-theme-css">`.  
   - WCAG AA contrast ratios, keyboard navigation (`tabindex`, `(keydown.enter)`), and ARIA attributes across all interactive elements.

6. **Clean Architecture**  
   - **Domain Layer:** `chart.model.ts`‚Äîpure TypeScript interfaces (`ChartConfig`, `ChartData`).  
   - **Application Layer:** `ChartHelperService` (event processing), `MediatorService` (event bus), `ChartDataService` (data fetching/caching).  
   - **Infrastructure Layer:** HTTP adapters, JSON fixtures in `assets/datasets/`, potential interceptors (auth/logging).  
   - **Presentation Layer:** Angular components & NG-Zorro UI, Gridster2 dashboard, shared buttons & modals.

## üìê Code Quality & Documentation

- **Linting & Formatting**  
  - ESLint flat-config (`eslint.config.js`) enforces TypeScript best practices, Angular style rules and template accessibility (`@angular-eslint/template-accessibility`).  
  - To lint all files, run the lint command as listed in ‚ÄúAvailable Scripts‚Äù.  
  - Automatic fixes can be applied where possible via the lint tool‚Äôs ‚Äúfix‚Äù option.

- **Static Analysis (SonarCloud)**  
  - A Quality Gate runs on every pull request.  
  - Key metrics: coverage > 80%, controlled cyclomatic complexity, zero critical vulnerabilities.  
  - The SonarCloud badge at the top of this README reflects current status.

- **Unit Testing**  
  - Karma for component and service tests.

- **Documentation (Compodoc)**  
  - Generates automatic HTML documentation for services, modules, components and interfaces.  
  - The output is served from the `documentation/` folder and can be viewed in a browser.
